## Conditions

Time to talk about what I do/do not.
- I work with music ([speed mixes](https://www.youtube.com/@Altimixes)).
- Back to study the programming after some days.
- I explore a bit of everything.
- Studying (or trying to study) hard for exams that will occur next month.

## Additional description

Account created with main purpose to contribute with translations and explore programming resources. For now I am lazy to describe more, but when I get time, will surely tell more than this here. That's all I would like to show about me for now. <3
