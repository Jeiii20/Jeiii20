## ‚Ñπ Introduction
Yo, if it's not the J in an alt profile (not alt any longer). Welcome to my very own main page.

## üé≠ Conditions
Time to talk about what I do/do not.
- I work with music ([speed mixes](https://www.youtube.com/@Altimixes)).

- I explore a bit of everything.
- Studying (or trying to study) hard for exams that will occur next month.
- Currently working for translations at Nebulous.io (will look for more places soon).

## ‚ûï Additional description
Account created with main purpose to contribute with translations and explore programming resources. For now I am lazy to describe more, but when I get time, will surely tell more than this here. That's all I would like to show about me for now. <3
